            <p>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". HyperText means it's a type of text that supports
hyperlinks between pages. Markup means we have taken a document and marked it up with code to tell
something (in this case, a browser) how to interpret the page. HTML code is built with tags,
each one starting with < and ending with >. These tags represent markup elements.</p>

            <h2><a href="">My second post</a> </h2>
            <p>Each HTML page is also divided into two elements: head and body.
We use head to tell the browser about the configuration of the page, and body to tell it what's actually on the page.</p>
